# SAN FRANCISCO FIRE DEPARTMENT
The Story

You're a consultant at ABC Consulting and have recently been assigned to a new client. Your manager has contacted you and let you know that you'll be working with a public service agency to help them visualize some data and make recommendations on their operational policies and procedures. In order to get you onboarded, he has gathered some information which might be helpful for you to review.

Using the provided data from the Computer Aided Dispatch (CAD) System along with your knowledge of data visualization tools and general business acumen - prepare to interview the Chief of the department. Unfortunately, the Chief is a busy guy and will only be able to meet with you for 1.5 hours before catching a flight to speak at an international conference, where he'll be unreachable for the duration of the project.

Your manager has asked that you prepare the questions you'd like to ask the chief and submit them to him via your internal collaboration platform (Blackboard) no later than Thursday, Nov 5th at the close of business (5pm). This will give him the opportunity to consolidate your input, along with that of your colleagues, into a single question list. Fortunately, you're entire team will attend the interview together and you'll all have the same sheet of questions. That said, each question will need to be voiced to the Chief by one of the consultants - he will not have a copy of the questions to read from during the interview.

Since time is so short, the Manager at your firm has worked out a pre-meeting between himself and the Chief on Tuesday morning at 11am. He'll ensure the Chief is prepared to answer the questions and provide other pertinent background information during your session on Thursday, November 12th, from 7:30-9pm.

Once the Chief leaves town on Thursday night at 9pm, he'll be unreachable until your project concludes on December 10th. Your only resource will be your Manager who has some domain experience in this area but is not as knowledgable as the Chief. Getting as much out of your initial interview as possible is critical to your success. Fortunately, your Manager is a subject matter expert (SME) on the data visualization tool that has been selected, PowerBI, so he'll be able to help if you run into technical challenges during the engagement
